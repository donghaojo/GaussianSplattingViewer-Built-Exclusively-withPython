Place this file under the 3dgs directory to use it. 

I created this file primarily for quickly viewing training results. This visualization file achieves visualization by calling some functions from 3dgs, so it can be easily modified and used in many projects. Additionally, the file is very simple, allowing for convenient addition of desired visualization features.
